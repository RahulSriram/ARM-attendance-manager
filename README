This is a Java application I wrote to help reduce paperwork in classrooms, which traditionally use a large log book to record all the details of each student, each day

As we know, that approach is very time inefficient, and can be improvised by automating the process

That's where my application tries to help. 
It does all the heavy lifting work of maintaining the records and performing calculations like attenndance percentage, which is very tedious to do manually, if you have a very large database

I'm always open to look in to any comments and bugs you may have found in my application
